# Geometric Fractals In Maya
## take a base object and make copies of it, link translation, rotation and scale

###Based on blender array modifiers: http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:2.6/Manual/Modifiers/Generate/Array

####Linear Arrays (Spirals)
Run linearArray.py in Maya python script editor. Then type makeArray() in to python command line in Maya. Play with position, rotation and scale of child of root node (pCube1). To view nodes look at Window -> Outliner.

####Branching Arrays
Run binarBranching.py in Maya python script editor. Will make cubes in the same place. Select a child node, either pCube2 or pCube3, of the root node (use the Outliner window). Try scaling, translating and rotating one of these two.
